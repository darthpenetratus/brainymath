# Brainymath

Brainymath is a mathematical platform designed for individuals who are passionate about mathematics and looking to enhance their skills. It offers a wide range of resources and tools for learning mathematics, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

## Technologies and Tools Used

To achieve our goals and create an interactive and user-friendly interface, we are utilizing the following technologies and tools:

### MathJax and KaTeX

- **MathJax**: A library for displaying mathematical formulas in web browsers. We use MathJax to ensure that complex mathematical expressions are rendered correctly and beautifully on our platform.
- **KaTeX**: A high-performance library for rendering mathematical formulas, providing rapid rendering speed. KaTeX is used in parts of the application where maximum display speed is crucial.

### D3.js and Plotly.js

- **D3.js**: A powerful library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the web. We employ D3.js for visualizing mathematical graphs and diagrams, allowing users to visually understand mathematical relationships and functions.
- **Plotly.js**: A library that offers even more capabilities for creating complex graphs and visualizations. Plotly.js is used for generating interactive 3D graphs and other complex visualizations that can aid in the study of mathematics.

### Three.js

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics objects in a web browser. Three.js enables us to create complex three-dimensional mathematical models and visualizations, making learning more immersive and interactive.

### ngx-mathjax

- **ngx-mathjax**: An Angular component that facilitates the integration of MathJax into Angular applications. This tool allows us to easily include mathematical formulas in our Angular application, ensuring their beautiful and accurate representation.

The use of these tools and technologies helps us create a platform that not only provides extensive mathematical resources but also makes the learning process interactive and engaging. We are committed to making the study of mathematics accessible and understandable for all our users.
